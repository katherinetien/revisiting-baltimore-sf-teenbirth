# Revisiting Teen Birth Rate Comparison in Baltimore, MD and San Francisco, CA. 
## Background Information 
A lack of sexual health services and education have perpetuated the increase in teenage pregnancy rates in Baltimore, MD, [especially in the city's BIPOC populations](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/170). One way to understand the prevalence of this public health crisis in minority groups is to observe data trends categorized by race within the city's neighborhoods. Using Opportunity Atlas data on teenage birth rates of low-income populations in Baltimore, MD and my hometown, San Francisco, CA, we can identify whether differences exist in teenage birth rates in certain populations of Baltimore and how these differences compare to those of another major city in the U.S. Ultimately, we can use such data trends to design effective policy to mitigate the rise in teenage pregnancy.
