# Revisiting Teen Birth Rate Comparison in Baltimore, MD and San Francisco, CA. 
## Background Information 
A lack of sexual health services and education have perpetuated the increase in teenage pregnancy rates in Baltimore, MD, [especially in the city's BIPOC populations](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/node/170). One way to understand the prevalence of this public health crisis in minority groups is to observe data trends categorized by race within the city's neighborhoods. Using Opportunity Atlas data on teenage birth rates of low-income populations in Baltimore, MD and my hometown, San Francisco, CA, we can identify whether differences exist in teenage birth rates in certain populations of Baltimore and how these differences compare to those of another U.S. metropolitan area. Ultimately, we can use such data trends to design effective policy to mitigate the rise in teenage pregnancy. 
## Business Question 
_How do health-related racial disparities contribute to teen birth rates of populations with low parent income in Baltimore, MD and San Francisco, CA?_
## Data Sources
Open data sourced from Opportunity Insights' [Opportunity Atlas](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/?geographic_level=0&topic=0&paper_id=1652#resource-listing), an online database of anonymous data following 20 million Americans from childhood to mid-30s with the goal of identifying areas of the United States with best and worst social mobility. We will compare Baltimore, MD and San Francisco, CA, using two datasets.
1. [Baltimore, MD](: this raw dataset contains the teenage birth rates for White and Black populations with low-income parents categorized by neighborhood in Baltimore City. 
1. [San Francisco, CA](sf-data.xlsx): contains the same metrics as the first dataset, categorized by neighborhood in San Francisco.
